# Othello_with_RL
Final project to complete the CS50 course. Also planning to add an RL agent to this.

This final project was developed by Pablo Petersen, with contributions from Jonas Petersen (RL agent). The game logic and multiplayer interface were developed by Pablo. The RL agent was an optional extension developed jointly.
